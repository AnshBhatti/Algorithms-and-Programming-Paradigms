# Algorithms-and-Programming-Paradigms
This repository is planned to contain implementations/examples for the following algorithms and programming paradigms:
1) Greedy algorithms
2) Bottom-up and top-down dynamic programming
3) Minimum-cost Spanning Tree using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
4) SSSP (Single Source Shortest Path) using Dijkstra's algorithm
5) Minimum-cost Hamiltonian circuit (Ex: Traveling Salesman Problem) using sorted edges and nearest neighbor algorithms

Note: As of now this repository contains an implementation of bottom-up dp. Will continue to add more as time goes on
